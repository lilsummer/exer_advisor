### Health Status of Cyclists


* Data source: CDC - BRFSS (https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/)
    * Includes data from 2011 - 2015
    
    
* Showing the chronic disease status of peopel who ride bicyles regularly
    * The older age groups show higher levels of chronic diseases risks (the bright color on the right side)
    * Cyclists who have higher exercise score tend to be heathier (the dark color on the higher level)
    
* I used Hierarchical Clustering to cluster the cyclists into four groups based on their exercise schedule, health status, sex, and age.
    * Group 1 and 2 are the prodominent groups.
    * Group 3 and 4 have lowest exercise scores (the squares and the crosses on the bottom right).

                             color = chronic, 
                             shape = group)) +
