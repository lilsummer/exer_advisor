To build a logistic regression model to predict the recommendation of cardio exercise, we utilized several variables related to biometrics and exercise information (independent variables). The predicted variable (dependent variable) is a variable about recommendation on cardio exercise. These varaibles are recorded in BRFSS survey by CDC. The data I am using include 15 years of surveys during 2000-2015. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

##### Building a logistic regression model


```{r cars}



```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
